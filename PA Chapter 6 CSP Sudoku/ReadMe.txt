This is a bonus assignment!

There are two problems in this assignment. The first one is to be solved by hand. The second one requires programming. 

The first one corresponds to exercise 7 of Chapter 6 of the textbook.

For the second problem you must design a Sudoku solver. For this problem, you should formulate it specifying the variables, 
their domains and constraints with their types (unary, binary, higher-order, global), analyzing the backtracking algorithm 
with alternative approaches that reduce the computation time, memory consumption, or lead to early detection of failing paths. 

You must only implement the approach that in your analysis is deemed more effective or efficient. For the algorithm implemented 
you must test and analyze it for at least three levels of Sudoku difficulty.
