For this project, you must choose to implement a card game or Domino player using any of the family of algorithms described 
in the videos or the supplementary reading provided in this chapter. You must analyze your choice against Minimax with or 
without   \alpha - \beta   pruning. In most games of interest even Minimax with  \alpha - \beta  pruning is unfeasible, 
but in any case, you must carry out an algorithm complexity analysis for the game you choose to justify your choice, 
for example Expectiminimax, or Monte Carlos Simulation.  

You are encouraged to use the software available in the AIMA 
code repository and Jupyter Notebooks which facilitate my grading of your report and the practical demo of your game 
player. Unless strongly justified, I will not accept a Poker player since it would need bluffing as part of the game 
strategy and for human players would be impossible to detect it and viceversa. You may not use deep learning, as that 
is not the subject of this chapter.
