For this homework assignment and all the programming assignments from now on, including your projects, you may use the 
UC Berkeley code repository for Python.

This homework assignment consists of the following two problems:

Exercise 3.9 · AIMA Exercises (aimacode.github.io) (problem 3.7 of the Russell, S. and Norvig, P. Artificial Intelligence: 
A Modern Approach. 3rd Edition)

Exercise 3.11 Search Exercises · AIMA Exercises (aimacode.github.io) ( 3.9 of the Russell, S. and Norvig, P. Artificial Intelligence: 
A Modern Approach. 3rd Edition)

I have attached two pages from the 3rd edition of the Russell, S. and Norvig, P. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach 
because the Figure 3.31 helps to visualize the problem 3.9 of the 4th edition.

In your report you must include explicitly the analysis and explanations for all the numerals of each of the two problems.  
You may include a Readme file with special instructions for running your program if needed.

Again, you are encouraged to use Jupyter Notebooks.
