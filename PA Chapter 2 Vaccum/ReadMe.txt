the project use the repository of aima java

For this homework assignment and all the programming assignments from now on, you may use the UC Berkeley code repository. For grading convenience, I encourage  the use of Python so that I can use only one IDE.

This homework assignment consists of two exercises:

1) Exercise 2.11 (which corresponds to exercise 2.8 in Russell & Norvig's textbook 3rd Edition); and 

2) Exercise 2.14 (which corresponds to exercise 2.11 in Russell & Norvig's textbook 3rd Edition).

These programming assignments or mini projects are graded with rubrics. The rubric for this assignment is an improved version of the rubric applied to the first programming assignment, and it is a general rubric for all the programming assignments. Some of the rubric criteria may not apply to all the assignments and so, they will be left blank when evaluating the assignments. When left blank, those criteria will not count towards the grade.
